# FTB Revelation Forestry Backpack Config

This Forestry backpack.cfg file is specific to the [FTB Revelation 1.4+](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-revelation/files) modpack using the Forestry for 1.12.2

The Forestry mod no longer by default, such as ladders and doors (among other items) to the Builder's backpack. This config file resolves this issue, plus adds many more items to all the backpacks. 

The Adventure backpack can now be used for many items as well. 

## Roadmap
I plan to add many items from other mods in this modpack. I would welcome others contributing to this config file; provided that any pull requests 

## Support
While I do plan to maintain this repo, bug reports regarding the backpacks should be posted to either: FTB Revelation or Forestry

I am rather new to git, therefore, I cannot provide support for any issues related to git.

Lastly, I am an older retired and disabled individual, so please be patient with response times.

Thank you,
CM
